## Overview of the Analysis

The analysis aims to develop a binary classifier using machine learning and neural networks to predict the success of funding applicants for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup. By analyzing a dataset of over 34,000 previously funded organizations, the goal is to create a model that can accurately determine the likelihood of success for future applicants. The data is preprocessed, features are identified, and categorical variables are encoded. A neural network model is designed, trained, and evaluated to calculate loss and accuracy. The model is then optimized through various techniques to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. The optimized model's results are saved for further analysis and application.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Data Preprocessing:
  * What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  - 
  
  * What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  - 

  * What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
  - 


* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - 

  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - 

  * What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
